In mathematics and computational science, the Euler methods are used for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a given initial value.
We tried to implement the euler methods and Runge Kutte method and compare their accuracy. We solved a set of ordinary differential equation to know the trajection of the satellite in moon and earth.
