# Trajection of Satellite 
We solved a set of ordinary differential equation to know the trajection of the satellite in moon and earth. In mathematics and computational science, the Euler methods are used for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a given initial value. We tried to implement the euler methods and Runge Kutte method and compare their accuracy.
